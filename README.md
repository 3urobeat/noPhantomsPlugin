# noPhantomsPlugin
This short & simple plugin for Spigot and Bukkit servers prevents Phantoms from spawning.  

Download the .jar: https://github.com/HerrEurobeat/noPhantomsPlugin/releases/latest  
...and put it into the `plugins` folder of your Spigot/Bukkit server. **Done!**  

This plugin was tested on 1.16 - 1.18 but should also work on other versions.
